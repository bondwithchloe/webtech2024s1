        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            
        <div class="hobby">
            <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>At college, I led the #1 entrepreneurial community on campus, eTower.org...</p>
            <button class="toggle" data-target="#communityDetails">More about community</button>
            <div id="communityDetails" class="details" style="display: none;">
                <p>
                    Community: Leading the number one entrepreneurial community on campus, eTower.org, was a crash course in leadership for me. 
                    I learned the best leadership lesson ever: servant leadership. Your role as a leader is to listen to the needs of your team and respond efficiently. 
                    We were more than a team—we became a family. Each challenge we faced taught me about resilience, strategy, and the importance of a shared mission, vision and core values.

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I started with piano, which unlocked the world of music for me...</p>
            <button class="toggle" data-target="#musicDetails">More about music</button>
            <div id="musicDetails" class="details" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        Music: Reshaped my worldview. A single note can evoke a scent, a surge of emotion, or even a vivid memory. 
                        It's become my mode of self-expression, my retreat for relaxation, and my tool for tapping into and conveying deep emotions. 
                        More than anything, music is my way of bringing people together, creating a shared experience out of thin air. 
                        Whether it's the familiar chords on my guitar or the steady pulse of the drums, each instrument has turned music into a universal language that speaks directly from my soul into people's hearts.

            <h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>I've always been incredibly sporty...</p>
            <button class="toggle" data-target="#sportsDetails">More about sports</button>
            <div id="sportsDetails" class="details" style="display: none;">
                <p>
                    Competitiveness courses through me; I live to push my limits and excel. 
                    My journey began with skiing and tennis, and as I grew, so did my repertoire—sailing, soccer rugby, and now skydiving and yoga have joined the ranks. 
                    With each new sport, I dive in headfirst, fueled by a drive to be the best version of myself. 
                    It's not just about winning; it's about the thrill of mastering new skills and the satisfaction of surpassing my previous bests. 
                    Each sport is a new chapter in my book of personal achievements, a testament to my love for challenge and growth.

                    Family: My family loves to build; whether it's with LEGOs or through solving complex puzzles. 
                    And our Sunday board game battles are epic, complete with Monopoly, Catan, and Risk. 
                    Those games were my first foray into strategy and negotiation, and they’ve stuck with me. 
                    It’s that love of problem-solving and friendly competition that’s been a driving force in my life.

            <p>Three topics that fascinate me: Systems thinking, neuroscience/healthtech, and history of society.</p>
            <button class="toggle" data-target="#learningDetails">More about my interests</button>
            <div id="learningDetails" class="details" style="display: none;">
                <p>I'm really into three things that I want to keep learning about: how societies have changed over time, how our brains can adapt and grow, and how everything is connected through systems. 
                    Understanding these topics better is helping me figure out how to bring out the best in people.
                    So, if you feel like you can help me complete my puzzle, please reach out!
