	<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
	<p>
		My mission is to promote a people-first mentality by sparking game-changing human connections in our virtual world.

		With the massive shift to remote/hybrid workplaces, people have become *disconnected* from their co-workers & company culture. At BOND, we *reconnect* remote teams & rebuild unique online company cultures by sparking virtual water-cooler chats through a daily gamified BONDing question.
		
		I am pursuing a B.S. in Business Administration and Management with a concentration in Technology & Entrepreneurship at <a href="http://www.babson.edu" target="_blank">Babson College</a>. As a trilingual/multinational citizen, I strive to empower individuals & companies on a global scale. I thrive in high-performing environments characterized by intense competition and actively seek connections with fellow risk-takers who share my passions in entrepreneurship, gamification, AI, and the future of work.
		
		BONDing Fact: My favorite movie quote, "Just Keep Swimming" from Finding Nemo, serves as a personal mantra, reflecting my unwavering determination and resilience in facing adversity.

	<h2 id="myhobby">My Hobby</h2>
	<p>
		Skydiving has profoundly shaped my entrepreneurial journey, instilling in me a unique blend of resilience, risk assessment, and clarity of vision. Each jump mirrors the unpredictable nature of business ventures, teaching me to embrace uncertainty and to thrive in rapidly changing environments. The freefall demands absolute focus, a skill that translates directly into my business decisions, where distractions must be set aside to concentrate on critical issues. Moreover, skydiving has honed my risk management abilities; just as I meticulously plan each dive considering all safety aspects, I approach business challenges with thorough analysis and strategic foresight. The exhilaration of the jump reminds me to find joy in the entrepreneurial process, cherishing the highs and learning from the lows. This hobby has not just been an adventure in the skies, but a transformative experience, shaping a mindset that is bold, agile, and unflinchingly forward-looking.
