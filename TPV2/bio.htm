            <h2 class="year">2003</h2>
            <p>I was born in Paris, France, on July 17, 2003. I don’t have memories from that time, but I’ve heard I was a very chubby baby, nicknamed "the buddha baby" by our neighbors. My mom, an incredible woman, ran a kindergarten in our basement, where my sister Tia, our neighbors, and I learned to laugh, cry, walk and talk together. </p>

            <h2 class="year">2008</h2>
            <p>In 2008, I moved from Paris to Beirut, Lebanon. It was a big change. I was the new girl with a French accent, and my cousin was my only friend. That year, I started playing guitar, improved my piano skills, began skiing, and took up tennis. It was a year of self-discovery.  </p>

            <h2 class="year">2010</h2>
            <p>By the time I was 7 I was fluent in three languages, three instruments: piano, guitar, drums, and three sports: tennis, skiing, Taekwon-do </p>

            <p>At 10, I joined the Girl Scouts, not realizing how much it would influence who I would become. I was a Girl Scout for eight years, learning leadership, teamwork, resilience, wilderness survival, and problem-solving under pressure. And a great bonus: I learned how to build cool structures like this one.</p>

            <p>At 14, after 6 weeks at Stanford I published a paper about utilizing nanobiomaterials found in butterfly wings to solve glaucoma</p>

            <p>At 15, inspired by my dad's complaints about the inefficiency of solar panels, I founded the Beirut Biomimics at my high school to improve solar technology using biomimicry. By 16, I was the youngest presenter at the World Biodiversity Forum in Davos.</p>

            <h2 class="year">2020</h2>
            <p>At 16, I launched the Impossible Lebanon Challenge, prompting high school students nationwide to address Lebanon's most pressing challenges. This led to the creation of a waste-to-energy biogarden, a mental health non-profit, and an innovative composting process inspired by ants.</p>

            <p>17, bittersweet. It was time to say goodbye to everything and everyone I knew. But, it was the start of an incredible journey at...Babson College</p>

            <p>At 19, I founded my company, led an all-female team, won three pitch competitions, and gained 900 sign-ups for our MVP within two weeks. I also earned my skydiving license.</p>
